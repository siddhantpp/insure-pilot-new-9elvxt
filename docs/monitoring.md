## Monitoring Infrastructure

### LGTM Stack Overview
The Documents View feature uses the LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) stack for comprehensive monitoring and observability:

- **Loki**: Log aggregation system that stores and indexes log data
- **Grafana**: Visualization platform for metrics, logs, and traces
- **Tempo**: Distributed tracing system for request flow visualization
- **Mimir**: Long-term metrics storage for scalable and reliable metrics

This integrated stack provides unified observability across all components of the Documents View feature, enabling correlation between metrics, logs, and traces for efficient troubleshooting and analysis.

### Component Interactions
The LGTM components interact as follows:

1. **Metrics Flow**:
   - Application components expose metrics endpoints
   - Prometheus scrapes metrics from endpoints
   - Prometheus forwards metrics to Mimir for long-term storage
   - Grafana queries metrics from Prometheus (real-time) and Mimir (historical)

2. **Logs Flow**:
   - Application components write structured logs
   - Promtail collects logs from files and Kubernetes pods
   - Logs are forwarded to Loki for storage and indexing
   - Grafana queries logs from Loki for visualization

3. **Traces Flow**:
   - Application components instrument code with OpenTelemetry
   - Traces are sent to OpenTelemetry Collector
   - Collector forwards traces to Tempo for storage
   - Grafana queries traces from Tempo for visualization

4. **Alerting Flow**:
   - AlertManager receives alerts from Prometheus, Mimir, and Loki
   - Alerts are grouped, deduplicated, and routed to notification channels
   - On-call engineers receive alerts through appropriate channels

### Deployment Architecture
The monitoring infrastructure is deployed using Kubernetes, with components distributed to ensure high availability and scalability:

- Each LGTM component runs as a separate deployment in Kubernetes
- Components are configured with appropriate resource limits and requests
- Persistent storage is used for data that must survive pod restarts
- Services expose components to each other and to the application
- Ingress controllers provide external access to Grafana

### Infrastructure Requirements
The monitoring infrastructure has the following resource requirements:

| Component | CPU (Request/Limit) | Memory (Request/Limit) | Storage |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Prometheus | 2 CPU / 4 CPU | 8GB / 16GB | 100GB |
| Loki | 2 CPU / 4 CPU | 4GB / 8GB | 500GB |
| Tempo | 1 CPU / 2 CPU | 2GB / 4GB | 200GB |
| Mimir | 2 CPU / 4 CPU | 8GB / 16GB | 1TB |
