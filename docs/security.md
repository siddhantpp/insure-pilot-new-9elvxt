# Security Documentation for Documents View

## 1. Introduction

This document provides comprehensive security documentation for the Documents View feature of Insure Pilot. It covers authentication mechanisms, authorization controls, data protection measures, audit logging, and other security aspects critical to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of insurance documents and related data.

### 1.1 Purpose

This security documentation serves as:
- A technical reference for developers implementing security controls
- A guide for security teams performing assessments and audits
- A compliance artifact for internal and external auditors
- A resource for operations teams managing the secure deployment of the Documents View feature

### 1.2 Scope

This document covers the security aspects of the Documents View feature, including:
- Authentication and identity management
- Authorization and access control mechanisms
- Data protection at rest and in transit
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Security architecture and zones
- Threat mitigation strategies
- Security testing methodologies
- Compliance requirements and controls

### 1.3 Security Principles

The Documents View feature adheres to the following core security principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect sensitive document data.
2. **Least Privilege**: Users are granted the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job functions.
3. **Secure by Default**: Security is built into the application architecture from the beginning, not added as an afterthought.
4. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
5. **Complete Mediation**: Every access to resources is checked for authorization.
6. **Fail Secure**: In case of failures, the system defaults to secure states rather than exposing functionality.
7. **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations require multiple users to complete.
8. **Auditability**: All security-relevant operations are logged for review and analysis.

## 2. Authentication Framework

The Documents View feature implements a comprehensive authentication framework to ensure secure access to document data and functionality.

### 2.1 Identity Management

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| User Identity | Laravel Sanctum | Authenticates users via token-based system |
| Identity Storage | MariaDB user tables | Stores user credentials and profile information |
| Identity Verification | Email verification | Ensures valid email addresses for account recovery |
| Account Lockout | Progressive delays | Prevents brute force attacks with increasing timeouts |

User accounts are stored in the database with the following security measures:
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a work factor of 12
- Email addresses are verified before account activation
- Failed login attempts trigger increasing delays:
  - 1 second after first failure
  - 5 seconds after second failure
  - 15 seconds after third failure
  - Account locked for 15 minutes after 5 consecutive failures

### 2.2 Token-Based Authentication

Documents View uses Laravel Sanctum for token-based authentication:

| Token Aspect | Implementation | Details |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Token Type | Bearer token | JWT-based authentication token |
| Token Lifespan | 24 hours | Tokens expire after 24 hours |
| Token Storage | HttpOnly cookies | Prevents JavaScript access to tokens |
| Token Refresh | Sliding expiration | Activity extends token lifespan |
| CSRF Protection | CSRF tokens | Protects against cross-site request forgery |

Authentication flow:

1. User logs in with username/password
2. System validates credentials against hashed values
3. On successful validation, a token is generated
4. Token is returned to client as an HttpOnly cookie
5. Subsequent requests include the token in Authorization header
6. Token is validated on each request for authenticity and expiration
7. Token is invalidated on logout or after 24 hours of inactivity

### 2.3 Multi-Factor Authentication

The Documents View supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative users and sensitive operations:

| MFA Method | Implementation | Applicability |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Time-based OTP | Google Authenticator compatible | Required for administrative users |
| Email Verification | One-time codes | Optional for standard users |
| SMS Verification | Twilio integration | Optional for standard users |

MFA is enforced for these specific operations:
- Bulk document processing
- Document deletion/restoration
- Override of processed document status
- Changing security settings
- Administrative functions

The MFA implementation follows these security standards:
- TOTP codes use SHA-1 with 6-digit codes and 30-second intervals
- Email verification codes expire after 10 minutes
- SMS codes expire after 5 minutes
- Failed MFA attempts are logged and limited to 3 before requiring re-authentication

### 2.4 Session Management

Session security is maintained through the following controls:

| Session Parameter | Value | Description |
|-------------------|-------|-------------|
| Session Timeout | 30 minutes | Automatic logout after inactivity |
| Idle Warning | 15 minutes | Warning displayed after initial inactivity |
| Concurrent Sessions | Allowed | Multiple devices permitted with separate tokens |
| Session Revocation | Immediate | Admin can force logout of any user session |

Session security mechanisms:
- Sessions are bound to IP addresses
- User-Agent consistency is verified
- Session IDs are regenerated after login
- Sessions are stored server-side with client-side reference tokens
- Session data is encrypted at rest

### 2.5 Password Policies

The Documents View enforces the following password security requirements:

| Policy | Requirement | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Minimum Length | 12 characters | Validated during password creation/change |
| Complexity | Letters, numbers, symbols | Must include at least one of each |
| History | No reuse of last 5 passwords | Checked against password history |
| Expiration | 90 days | Users prompted to change password |
| Failed Attempts | 5 attempts before lockout | Progressive delays between attempts |

Password policies are enforced through:
- Server-side validation during registration and password changes
- Regular expression pattern matching for complexity requirements
- Password history tables to prevent reuse
- Scheduled checks for password expiration
- Failed login tracking with progressive lockouts

## 3. Authorization System

The Documents View implements a robust authorization system to control access to documents and related functionality based on user roles and permissions.

### 3.1 Role-Based Access Control

The system implements a hierarchical role structure with granular permissions:

| Role | Description | Permission Level |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Administrator | Full system access | All permissions |
| Manager | Department-level access | Most permissions except system configuration |
| Claims Adjuster | Document processing for claims | View, edit, process documents |
| Underwriter | Document processing for policies | View, edit, process documents |
| Support Staff | Basic document handling | View, edit documents |
| Read-Only User | Document viewing only | View documents only |

Document-specific permissions:

| Permission | Description | Default Roles |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| document.view | View document content and metadata | All roles |
| document.edit | Edit document metadata | Admin, Manager, Adjuster, Underwriter, Support |
| document.process | Mark documents as processed | Admin, Manager, Adjuster, Underwriter |
| document.trash | Move documents to trash | Admin, Manager |
| document.restore | Restore documents from trash | Admin, Manager |
| document.delete | Permanently delete documents | Admin |
| document.override | Override document locks | Admin, Manager |

### 3.2 Permission Management

Permissions are managed through the following mechanisms:

- Permissions are stored in the database in a normalized structure
- Roles are associated with permissions through a many-to-many relationship
- Users are assigned to roles (and optionally directly to permissions)
- Permission assignments are cached for performance (with 15-minute TTL)
- Permission changes take effect immediately by invalidating relevant cache entries

Permission evaluation sequence:
1. Check for direct user-to-permission assignments
2. Check for permissions assigned through user roles
3. Apply any contextual restrictions (e.g., department, document ownership)
4. Make final authorization decision

### 3.3 Resource Authorization

Access to documents is controlled at multiple levels:

| Resource Level | Authorization Check | Example |
|----------------|---------------------|---------|
| Document | Ownership and relationship | User must own document or be in same department |
| Metadata Fields | Field-level permissions | Some users may view but not edit certain fields |
| Actions | Action-specific permissions | Only certain roles can process documents |
| Context | Context-based restrictions | Department restrictions, business relationships |

Resource authorization utilizes Laravel's policy mechanism:

```php
// DocumentPolicy.php example (simplified)
public function view(User $user, Document $document)
{
    // Basic permission check
    if (!$user->can('document.view')) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Ownership check
    if ($document->created_by === $user->id) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Department check
    if ($user->department_id === $document->department_id) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Relationship check (e.g., documents for user's clients)
    return $user->clients()->where('id', $document->client_id)->exists();
}
```

### 3.4 Policy Enforcement Points

Authorization is enforced at multiple points in the application:

| Enforcement Point | Implementation | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Controller Layer | Laravel Policies | Validates permissions before actions |
| Service Layer | Authorization checks | Enforces business rules |
| View Layer | Conditional rendering | Shows/hides UI elements based on permissions |
| API Gateway | Token validation | Prevents unauthorized API access |

Each request follows this authorization flow:
1. Authentication validation (token verification)
2. Basic permission check for the requested action
3. Resource-specific policy evaluation
4. Business rule validation
5. Audit logging of the authorization decision

## 4. Data Protection

The Documents View implements multiple layers of data protection to secure sensitive document content and metadata.

### 4.1 Encryption Standards
