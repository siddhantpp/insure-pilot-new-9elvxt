## Advanced Features

### Type-ahead Filtering

The `DropdownControl` component provides type-ahead filtering for dropdown fields:
- As the user types, the dropdown options are filtered in real-time
- Filtering is performed client-side for responsiveness
- The `useDebounce` hook prevents excessive API calls for server-side filtering

### Dependent Fields

Metadata fields can depend on other fields:
- When a parent field changes, dependent fields are updated

- `lint.yml`: Lints the code
- `security-scan.yml`: Scans for security vulnerabilities
- `deploy.yml`: Deploys the application to Kubernetes

## Best Practices and Patterns

### Component Structure

Components follow a consistent structure:
- Props interface definition
- Component function with JSDoc comments
- State initialization
- Event handlers
- Return statement with JSX

### State Management

State management follows these patterns:
- Local component state for UI-specific state
- Context API for shared state
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Props for parent-child communication

### Error Handling

Error handling is comprehensive:
- Try-catch blocks for async operations
- Error boundaries for component errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed error logging

### Performance Optimization

Performance is optimized through:
- Memoization with `React.memo` and `useCallback`
- Debouncing for frequent operations
- Lazy loading for components
- Efficient rendering with proper key usage

### Security

Security is ensured through:
- Input validation on both client and server
- Authentication and authorization checks
- CSRF protection
- Secure API communication
